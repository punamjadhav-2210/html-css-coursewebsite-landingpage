# Course Website Landing Page

This project is a simple web page made with only HTML and CSS.
When you open the project.html file in a browser, it shows a nice-looking landing page for a course or mentorship website.
We teach different new high paying courses in free for student who wanted to grow.
The page includes sections like a welcome message, student profiles, and different learning programs.
HTML is used to build the structure of the page, and CSS is used to make it look good with colors, layout, and fonts.
The design also works well on phones, tablets, and computers because of responsive styling. 
There is no JavaScript or backend, so the website is fast and easy to use.
